## Self-hosting Screenity

You can run Screenity locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store. Here's how:

1. Download the latest Build.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/screenity/releases)
2. Load the extension by pasting `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
3. Drag the folder that contains the code (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the "Load unpacked" button and locate the folder.
4. That's it, you should now be able to use Screenity locally. [Follow these instructions](#enabling-save-to-google-drive) to set up the Google Drive integration.

## Creating a development version

2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Load the extension by going to `chrome://extensions/` , and [enabling developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
